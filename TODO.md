# Deferred Work

## ResourceGridView

- [ ] Virtualization — only render rows within the visible scroll viewport
- [ ] Overflow popovers — when too many events overlap, show "+N more" chip
- [ ] Drag-to-create — click and drag on empty cells to create new events
- [ ] Drag-to-move — drag existing events to reposition them
- [ ] Drag-to-resize — drag event edges to change duration
- [ ] Availability slots — render available/unavailable time regions
- [ ] Half-hour gridline styling — lighter borders for sub-hour intervals
- [ ] Keyboard navigation — arrow keys to move between events
- [ ] ARIA attributes — proper grid role and live region announcements
- [ ] Edge case - render events in two parts when they cross the midnight boundary
- [ ] Edge case - render multi-day (non-all-day) events properly
