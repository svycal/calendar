# Deferred Work

## ResourceGridView

- [ ] Bug - at ~50% scrolled along the x-axis, the gutter no longer sticks to the left and scrolls out of view
- [ ] Virtualization — only render rows within the visible scroll viewport
- [ ] Overflow popovers — when too many events overlap, show "+N more" chip
- [ ] Drag-to-move — drag existing events to reposition them
- [ ] Drag-to-resize — drag event edges to change duration
- [ ] Keyboard navigation — arrow keys to move between events
- [ ] ARIA attributes — proper grid role and live region announcements

## WeekView

- [ ] Full implementation (currently placeholder)
